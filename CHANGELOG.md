## [1.4.1] — 2026-04-02 — Bug Fixes

### Fixed (Bugs — broken patterns causing immediate failures)
- **B1/T1:** `conftest.py` was missing all model fixtures (`customer`, `product`, `order`). Added full `factory_boy` pattern — `core/factories.py` (UserFactory), per-app `tests/factories.py`, project-level `conftest.py`, and app-level `conftest.py` fixtures
- **B2:** Frontend error mock used wrong shape `{ customerId: ['Required'] }`. Now uses correct `{ success: false, message, errors }` via `mockApiError()` helper in `src/test/mocks.ts`
- **B3:** `renderWithStore` was hardcoded to `{ orders: ordersReducer }`. Now generic — accepts `reducers` and `preloadedState` as params
- **B4:** `index.ts` was exporting selectors from `ordersSlice` — should export from `selectors.ts` (added in v1.4.0)
- **B5:** `components.md` list component used inline selector `useAppSelector(s => s.orders)` — violates v1.4.0 rule. Fixed to use `selectOrders` from `selectors.ts`
- **B6:** `components.md` `useEffect` had no `promise.abort()` cleanup — violates v1.4.0 rule. Fixed
- **B7:** Form catch block cast error as `Record<string, string[]>` — wrong. Now uses `isApiError()` type guard with correct `ApiError` shape
- **B8/G2:** `models.md` project structure was stale — missing `core/serializers.py`, `core/permissions.py`, `core/factories.py`, `conftest.py`, `pytest.ini`, `requirements.txt`

### Added (Missing test coverage)
- **T1:** `factory_boy` pattern — `DjangoModelFactory` + `Faker` for all models; fixtures use factories
- **T2:** `dodolete` child tests — verifies soft-delete (not hard-delete), new child creation, existing child update
- **T3:** `GetPermission` tests — user with permission (200), without (403), superuser bypass (200)
- **T4:** Serializer unit tests — `validate_<field>` and `validate()` tested directly without API call
- **T5:** Zod rejection test — malformed API response handled and error shown
- **T6:** `@pytest.mark.parametrize` — negative payload cases now tested in one parametrized block
- **T7:** `FilteredListSerializer` test — verifies soft-deleted children excluded from GET response
- **T8:** `userEvent` replaces `fireEvent` throughout frontend tests — simulates real browser behaviour
- **T9:** Selector unit tests — all selectors tested in isolation including memoization verification
- **T10:** Project-level `conftest.py` — shared fixtures (`api_client`, `user`, `superuser`, `authenticated_client`, `superuser_client`) available to all apps

### Added (Other gaps)
- **G1:** `requirements.txt` pattern with section comments (Core Django, Testing, Development, Validation)
- **G3:** `pytest.ini` template at project root — required for `pytest-django` to find settings
- **G4:** `__init__.py` noted as required in every `tests/` folder for test discovery
- **G5:** `StatusBadge` import added to list component pattern (was used but never imported)
- `isApiError` type guard strengthened — now checks `success`, `message`, AND `errors` fields
- `mockApiError()` test helper added to `src/test/mocks.ts`
- Error response shape tests added — 401 and 404 verify `{ success, message, errors }` contract

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Critical:** `update()` previously hard-deleted nested children (`instance.items.all().delete()`). Now soft-deletes via `is_deleted=True, is_active=False, deleted_at=now()` — never hard deletes.
- **Critical:** `create()` and `update()` now wrapped with `@transaction.atomic` — prevents orphaned parent records when child creation fails midway.

### Added
- `FilteredListSerializer` (core/serializers.py) — `list_serializer_class` on every child serializer; auto-filters `is_deleted=False` children on all GET responses
- `dodelete` pattern — child serializers expose `dodelete = BooleanField(write_only=True, required=False)`; `update()` checks flag to soft-delete specific children instead of replacing all
- `id = UUIDField(required=False)` on child serializers — distinguishes existing children (update) from new ones (create) in a single PATCH payload; uses IntegerField for legacy int PK models
- `SerializerMethodField` guidance — pattern for computed fields (display names, aggregates, derived booleans); enforces no DB queries inside method fields
- `GetPermission` factory (core/permissions.py) — Django model permissions via `permission_classes = [GetPermission('app.action_model')]`; all views must explicitly set `permission_classes`
- FK queryset filtering — all FK `queryset=` arguments now filter `is_deleted=False`
- `selectors.ts` — every feature gets a dedicated selectors file using `createSelector`; no inline selectors in components
- `dispatch().abort()` cleanup — every data-fetching `useEffect` returns abort cleanup function
- Error state reset — every `pending` extraReducer case sets `error: null`; `clearError` dispatched before manual re-fetches
- `api-versioning.md` reference — when to create v2, `DeprecationMixin` pattern, frontend version constants
- Breaking change question added to Phase 0 clarifying questions for update tasks

### Changed
- Serializer plan sub-tasks now always start with Zod schemas + types, then selectors.ts
- All three SKILL.md review checklists expanded with new items
- `django-app-scaffold.py` template updated with `FilteredListSerializer` and `GetPermission`

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- `core/exceptions.py` — standardised API error response `{ success, message, errors }` enforced on all endpoints
- `CLAUDE.md` auto-generation — skill creates project context file on first run, reads it on subsequent runs to skip redundant analysis
- Serializer field validation — `validate_<field>()` and `validate()` patterns added to reference + Phase 0 now explicitly asks for business rules
- Environment variables pattern — `python-decouple` + `settings/base|development|production.py` + `.env.example` template in `error-settings.md`
- `index.ts` barrel export — every feature folder must end with a barrel export sub-task; clean single import path per feature
- Zod runtime schema validation — all GET responses validated via `ZodSchema.parse()` in service layer; types inferred from schemas
- `ApiError` type — `{ success, message, errors }` typed and used in all catch blocks
- Git commit suggestions — after every task the skill suggests a meaningful commit message
- `__str__` enforcement — added to model checklist and review checklist
- `CLAUDE.md` reading step — Phase 0 now checks for and reads `CLAUDE.md` before any codebase analysis
- `error-settings.md` reference file (backend) — covers exception handler, settings, env vars, CORS
- `exports-validation.md` reference file (frontend) — covers index.ts patterns and Zod validation
- `CLAUDE.md.template` asset — used for auto-generation on new projects
- Business rule violations added to test case generation in all three skills
- Error response shape contract added to API CONTRACT section of plan template

### Changed
- Phase 0 of all three skills now starts with CLAUDE.md check before codebase analysis
- Plan template updated: BUSINESS RULES section added, Zod sub-task listed first in frontend tasks
- Review checklist expanded across all three skills with new items

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- `django-backend-dev` — standalone Django REST Framework skill (backend only)
- `react-frontend-dev` — standalone React + TypeScript skill (frontend only)
- `compatibility` frontmatter field declaring required tools per skill
- Example prompts section in all three SKILL.md files for better auto-triggering
- Conditional reference loading — only relevant reference files load per task
- Split `backend.md` into focused files: `models.md`, `serializers-views.md`, `admin-testing.md`, `orm-settings.md`
- Split `frontend.md` into focused files: `state-api.md`, `components.md`, `shared-library.md`, `testing.md`
- Code templates moved to `assets/templates/` — only loaded during implementation tasks
- Concise plan format instruction to reduce token padding
- Token budget constraint on codebase analysis agent prompt

### Changed
- `django-react-dev` now acts as an orchestrator — delegates to backend/frontend skills
- SKILL.md Phase 3 reference pointers updated to new split file paths
